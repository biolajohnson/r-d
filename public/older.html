            We met, it seems, such a short time ago<br />
            You looked at me, needing me so<br />
            Yet from your sadness<br />
            Our happiness grew<br />
            And I found out I needed you too<br />
            I remember how we used to play<br />
            I recall those rainy days<br />
            The fire's glow<br />
            That kept us warm<br />
            And now I find, we're both alone<br />
            Goodbye may seem forever<br />
            Farewell is like the end<br />
            But in my heart is a memory<br />
            And there you'll always be<br />
            Goodbye may seem forever<br />
            Farewell is like the end<br />
            But in my heart is a memory<br />
            And there you'll always be

            The night you leave, <br />the sky breaks out in stars. <br />They
            burn like open sores. <br />The acacia, scarred from private wars,
            still has leaves.
            <br />
            I am not radical in my sorrow.<br />
            What has come before,<br />
            that which has been handed down— these are my only methods.
            <br />
            I feel what I feel should be felt. <br />I say nothing new, nothing
            different. <br />My concerns are as they were before: is the tea too
            cold to drink? <br />
